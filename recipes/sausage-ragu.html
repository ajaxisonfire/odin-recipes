    <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>This sausage ragu is adapted from Julia Moskin's recipe in the New York Times. Make sure to
            to cook the vegetables over very low heat for at least 45 minutes until they melt into the fat, <strong>do not skip this step</strong>. It
            is essential to the final flavors. Adding ground beef makes the sauce <em>meatier</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>Serve over a pasta shape that will hold onto the sauce, such as rigatoni, cavatelli, or farfale.</p>
