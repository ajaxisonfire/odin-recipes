    <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>This sausage ragu is adapted from Julia Moskin's recipe in the New York Times. Make sure to
            to cook the vegetables over very low heat for at least 45 minutes until they melt into the fat, <strong>do not skip this step</strong>. It
            is essential to the final flavors. Adding ground beef makes the sauce <em>meatier</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>Serve over a pasta shape that will hold onto the sauce, such as rigatoni, cavatelli, or farfale.</p>

            <li>1 carrot, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 large cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can whole or crushed San Marzano tomatoes.</li>
            <li>1 large sprig rosemary</li>
            <li>1 pound dried pasta</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove sausage from casing and break up into 1-inch pieces.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a wide dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat and add sausage and ground beef.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make a sofrito. Combine onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in blender and process until
                    vegetables are broken down to a chunky paste, but not pureed.</li>
                <li>When sausage and beef is opaque and no longer pink, do not brown, add the sofrito and parsley to the pot.
                    Reduce heat to low. Season with a good pinch of salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Cook over very low heat until the sofrito has melted into the fat and the meat is starting to
                    brown, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Raise heat to medium and add tomato paste. Cook, stirring, until tomato paste has darkened in color
                    and is starting to caramelize, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the can of tomatoes and rosemary. If using whole tomatoes, break them into chunks against the 
                    side of the pot with a spoon. Fill the can with water halway and swirl to collect juices, 
                    add to pot.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and holds its shape.</li>
                <li>To finish, heat a medium saute pan over medium-high. Toss sauce with aldente pasta, a pad of butter,
                    and a splash of the pasta cooking water. Cook until sauce coats noodles.</li>
                <li>Ladel pasta into bowls and top with more sauce, parmesan, and reserved parsley.</li>
            </ol>
