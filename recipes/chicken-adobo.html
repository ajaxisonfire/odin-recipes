    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish that's as savory as it is bright with acid, 
            and it goes perfectly with a large platter of garlic fried rice.</p>
    
        <p>There are two truths about chicken adobo: Every Filipino family has its own recipe 
            (and that recipe is definitely the best), and every chicken adobo tastes better the 
            day after it's been cooked. The dish is uniquely Filipino, despite the fact that the 
            word is Spanish and refers to dishes with some surface similarities in Mexico and Spain. 
            But when used to refer to Filipino cuisine, it denotes both a cooking method—basically, 
            a very acidic braise—and the class of dishes produced by that method.</p>
