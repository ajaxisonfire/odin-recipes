    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish that's as savory as it is bright with acid, 
            and it goes perfectly with a large platter of garlic fried rice.</p>
    
        <p>There are two truths about chicken adobo: Every Filipino family has its own recipe 
            (and that recipe is definitely the best), and every chicken adobo tastes better the 
            day after it's been cooked. The dish is uniquely Filipino, despite the fact that the 
            word is Spanish and refers to dishes with some surface similarities in Mexico and Spain. 
            But when used to refer to Filipino cuisine, it denotes both a cooking method—basically, 
            a very acidic braise—and the class of dishes produced by that method.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) canola oil or other neutral oil</li>
                <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken legs, separated into thighs and drumsticks</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>3 whole dried bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
                <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. 
                    Blot chicken dry with paper towels, then season lightly all over with salt.</li>
                <li>Working in batches if necessary, add chicken pieces to pot in a single layer, skin side down, 
                    making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook until well browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Using tongs, 
                    flip chicken pieces and cook until lightly brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. 
                    Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to now-empty pot and cook, stirring constantly, 
                    until mixture is very fragrant and garlic turns a light golden color, about 30 seconds. 
                    Add water and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. 
                    Add soy sauce and vinegar, return chicken pieces to pot, increase heat to high, and bring 
                    liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through and 
                    tender, about 20 minutes, turning the chicken pieces halfway through.</li>
                <li><strong>To Serve:</strong>The chicken is best served after sitting overnight in the refrigerator 
                    (see note), but it can also be served immediately, with steamed white rice or (preferably) garlic 
                    fried rice. The chicken pieces can also be briefly broiled before serving.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Chicken adobo is improved immensely by being refrigerated overnight, due to the way the cooked vinegar mellows 
        over time.</p>
